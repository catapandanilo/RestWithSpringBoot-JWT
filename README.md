- HATEOAS.
> Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a component of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from  other network application architectures.
  With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.
    
- Value Object (VO).
> A Value Object is an immutable type that is distinguishable only by the state of its properties. ... Frequently, the Value Object can define helper methods (or extensions methods) that assist with such operations.

- CORS.
> Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows JavaScript on a web page to make AJAX requests to another domain, different from the domain from where it originated. By default, such web requests are forbidden in browsers, and they will result into same origin security policy errors. Using Java CORS filter, you may allow the webpage to make requests from other domains as well (known as cross domain requests).
